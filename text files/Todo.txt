Done:
    1. Figure out the padding in the navigation bar between "lifecoin" and 
       "how it works"
       **ANSWER** : Because the nav bar is a flexbox, using "justify-content: space between"
                    evenly distributes the items in the nav bar. Since technically there's
                    only 2 items in the nav bar at that level, there exists a big gap
                    in between the two.
    2. Figure out how "grid-template-columns" works and why there are two columns
       in hero even though there is only one "1fr"
        **Still can't figure this out, ask friend for help**
       **ANSWER** : There actually wasn't anything wrong with the implementation of 
                    grid-template-columns. The issue stems from a tag @media that
                    is designed to override all other css formatting in order to 
                    adjust really important stuff to fit different screen sizes. 
                    This was overriding the css for the hero box and creating two
                    columns rather than one whenever the screen size was big enough.
    3. move the css properties to a seperate css file 
       Done! The css for the main page can be found in mainCSS.css
    4. Create a server for the website, whether it is through github or amazonAWS
       Done! The website can be found at: https://shawns-spaghetti.github.io/LifeCoin.github.io/
Short Term:
    - Currently, the logo is rendering in the github page. I need to figure out 
      why this is happening and fix the code so that the logo does render properly. 
    - The logo is also not a square, probably because of something to do with the
      css. Let's make sure to fix that so it becomes a square again.
Long Term:
    - Create the backend code for the program, including an AI image recognition
      system that will be able to tag health indicators
